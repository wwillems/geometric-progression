# Sequencer

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_progression

## Problem definition

Given a list of integers, identify sequences where successive numbers exactly ​N​ indexes apart have a value equal to ​N​ multiplied by the previous number in the sequence.

### Rules
  - N​ must be greater than 1
  - Sequences with less than 3 entries should be ignored
  - Sequences returned must always be the longest possible for a given value of ​N. n other words, there is max one resulting sequence for any value of ​N.
  - Sequences of ​all​ zeros do not count

## Example

Consider the following list of integers: 2, 10, 4, 3, 8, 6, 9, 9, 18, 27

The following sequences are found: 
  - 2, 4, 8 (for ​N=2​) 
  - 3, 9, 27 (for ​N=3​)

### Build project and run tests 
```sh
$ mvn clean install
```


### Run main 
```sh
$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.trajectumservices.sequencer.Main"
```
